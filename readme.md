I wanted to see how the turnover of available dogs was, how many are adopted and especially how often dogs get returned. So I wrote a small Python script.

Created feature that 
* get the dog and id, save in csv for date. This lends the possibility to easier see if a dog has been adopted and then returned to the shelter. Example:
*   > 20201207, 20201214, 20201221, 20201228
    > Atilla_1021, Atilla_1021, Albert_321, Atilla_1021,
    > Albert_321, Albert_321, Zipp_34, Albert_321
    > Zipp_34, Zipp_34


[Next Steps]
* Some kind of scheduling could be nice
* Support for getting dogs from hundstallet would grow the usability
