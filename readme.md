"We" are looking into the possibility to adopt a dog from a dog shelter "around here", so I wanted to see how the turnover of available dogs was, how many are adopted and especially how often dogs get returned. So I wrote a small Python script.

20210110: Refactorized code and got support for multiple shelters. So now I can get info on Hundstallet too, yey!

20201229: Created feature that 
* get the dog and id, save in csv for date. This lends the possibility to easier see if a dog has been adopted and then returned to the shelter. Example:
*   > 20201207,20201214,20201221,20201228
    > Atilla_1021,Atilla_1021,Albert_321,Atilla_1021,
    > Albert_321,Albert_321,Zipp_34,Albert_321
    > Zipp_34,,Zipp_34


[Next Steps]
* Some kind of scheduling could be nice
* Deploying the code to some serverless platform would be nice. 
* * That would require saving the files in some file cloud.
